# Development Updates

This document includes all development updates by contributors to EPF cohort 4. [Learn more](/program-guide/repo-guide.md#development-updates) about creating your development updates.

Add your name alphabetically and link your updates to corresponding tables below by opening a PR. Iterate numbers of your updates and always place them into the current week. Editing a big raw markdown table can cause problems, use a tool for editing md or transforming from other format.

## Phase 1

Phase one is the very begining of the cohort. The first few weeks are dedicated to general learning about the EPF program, Ethereum protocol as whole and it's development.

## Phase 2

With the gained insight into the protocol, the following weeks serve as a deep dive into a chosen topic. By the first month, you should finish the initial research about a specific problem and propose a project, inluding a roadmap. Get some ideas from the [project proposal template](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/project-template.md)

| Name/GH | Week 3 | Week 4 | Project proposal |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
|         |        |        |                  |

## Phase 3

The actual project development is the main part of the program. Post your regular progress updates here during the development phase, share your issues and successes with others.

| Name/GH | Week 5 | Week 6 | Week 7 | Week 8 | Week 9 | Week 10 | Week 11 | Week 12 | Week 13 | Week 14 | Week 15 |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|         |        |        |        |        |        |         |         |         |         |         |         |

## Cohort end

The final weeks of the cohort should mark the finalization of your project. Submit your last dev update which is reflecting the overall project progress, its next steps and your experience with EPF. You can also link a video or document presenting the final stage of your project.

| Name/GH | Final dev update | Project presentation |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
|         |                  |                      |

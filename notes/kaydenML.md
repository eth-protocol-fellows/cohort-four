# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming and problem-solving skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

Glados

- Project Proposal
  - https://github.com/KaydenML/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/Glados-PortalNetwork.md

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.

## Working on Next 

- Now That the DHT Census is Implemented I'm going to be finishing implementing my pie chart graph https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/136  as soon as I posible can and then start working on implementing some of the other graphs I want to implement that required the DHT Census to be implemented before I could work on them like.
    - The average data radius of nodes on the network
    - The estimated total storage within a given network


- I'm going to be looking into dynamically loading everything on the Content Dashboard which will great improve the runtime complexity, currently glados's Content Dashboard loads fairly slow so I'm wanting to begin implementing this as soon as I can 


- Navigation Imrpovments I'm going to be looking it next now that I've implemented Segmental Control to the Content Dashboard, as time goes on I might come up with other navigational feature to implement
    - Nav Bar/ Top Navigation Feature 
    - Breadcrumb Links


- Do more research into the Portal Network, Glados, DiscV5, Kademlia and more.


- Continue UI improvments where needed, where probably going to be showing glados at Dev Connect so we want glados looking as clean as possible


- Look into more ethereum resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum over all.
